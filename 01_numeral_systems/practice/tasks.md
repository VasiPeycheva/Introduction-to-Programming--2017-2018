# **Numeral system - tasks**

1. Calculate:
   ```
    2543(10) = ?(2)
    485(10)  = ?(2)
    1024(10) = ?(2)

    101011(2)    = ?(10)
    110100101(2) = ?(10)
    010111010(2) = ?(10)

    101010110110(2) = ?(16)
    2164(10)        = ?(16)

    10101(2) | 110100(2) = ?(2)
    1101(2)  & 1010(2)   = ?(2)
    !101010101(2)        = ?(2)
   ```

2. Check your result with the calculator on your computer (use programmer mode)

3. Take a look at the content of an arbitrary file with binary/hex editor.
  - for Windows users: use Visual Studio -> File -> Open -> File -> Open with -> Binary Editor
  - for Linux users: `$hexdump -C <file>`
