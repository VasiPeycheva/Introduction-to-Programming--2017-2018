## Small project
---

We are going to implement a very simple, but still quite handy game.<br>
It's going to be a 2D maze with a player and a goal within it. The player's task is<br>
to reach the target, but there are a few obstacles - some of the maze's cells<br>
are covert in lava. The game will have two modes:<br>
* automatic   - the computer will play by it's own
<br> (Lol, is this an AI?! No, but backtracking algorithm.)
* interactive - we are going to use the arrows as an input - to control the hero.<br>
