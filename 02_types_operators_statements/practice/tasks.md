# **Tasks - primitive data types and operators**

1. Read a three-digit number from the standard input and reverse its digits.

    Example:
    ```
   	Input:  827
    Output: 728
    ```
#

2. Read two boolean variables from the standard input</br> 
and print the result of the boolean operators applied to them. (&, | , ^) 
#

3. Create a program that reads three variables</br> 
representing triangle sides (a,b,c) and checks</br>
whether the sides form a valid triangle.
#

4. Create a program that calculates triangle area when you have as input:
- Base and Height
- Three sides 
#

5. Create a program that reads two variables and swaps their values.

    Example:
    ```
    Input:  5 7
    Output: 7 5
    ```
#

6. Create a program that reads two 4-byte integers “p” and “q”</br>
and prints the quotient and the remainder left over after dividing p by q.


    Example:
    ```
    Input: 4 2
    Output: quotient = 2, remainder = 0
    ```
#

7. Create a program that accepts from the console 3 integer</br> numbers - coefficients of a quadratic equation(a,b,c). </br> Find all solutions(roots) and print them on the standard output.
#

8. Create a program that reads 4-byte integer and</br> prints his absolute value on the standard output.
#

9. Create a program that reads 4 integer numbers.</br> The first two numbers form a pair that represents a point coordinates. </br> Respectively, the last two numbers form another coordinates of a point. </br> Find the distance between the two points and print the result on the console.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Input:  2 1 4 5  // A(x1 = 2, y1 = 1), B(x2 = 4, y2 =5)
    Output: distance = 4.47214
    ```

10. Write a program that checks whether a point with coordinates</br>
P(x,y) (where x,y are integer numbers) is inside the given figure.
